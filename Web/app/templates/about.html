                            ARPerception is a tribute oriented for People & the founder to express their views with pure conscience. A maverick way of expression is always graced by the society which is unaware of such byplay of Logics & perceptiveness. ARPerception staunchly believes that you must have a view, a perception for a particular cause, henceforth, you must vouch for it.

                            This platform allows everyone to wear an opinion like armor, a shield of faith, a tool of fraternity & calmness of a monk. At the same time it dissolves those who make mockery of constitutional rights, social responsibilities and simple logics hiding behind the shadow of Freedom of Expression.

                            This also gives a privilege to the People who need psychological suggestions, career counseling or a dear friend to have a chat about Life, work & everything, you are sure to receive an answer. This tribune acts as a human library for all those who wants to express their perception on different aspects of life in their own beautiful way. They are free to share their personal experiences, events that made them stronger, realization that made them conquer their weaknesses, and thoughts that are buried deep inside their heart. Pessimism has no place in our Life. Some experiences are both fascinating and exhausting. This Tribune cum human library is an attempt to create a simultaneous social and personal space where you are free to choose your way. Here on this platform we firmly believe that people should precisely examine, look and for once, just for once perceive what they truly feel. We must not forget that even the most beautiful things in the universe have dents and scratches too.
